A candidate's application is evaluated by reviewing their work history for relevant experience, checking their education and certifications, assessing their skills and qualifications, and verifying their references. The applicant's availability and personal situation are also evaluated. Additional information, including personal information and employment history, may be collected, and the candidate's consent is obtained for their information to be used for the hiring process while ensuring that their information is securely stored in compliance with data privacy regulations. If the candidate seems like a good fit for the position, an interview is scheduled with the candidate and stakeholders, and the interview is prepared and conducted. Finally, either a professional rejection letter is sent, or a clear and concise contract offer is prepared, and sent together with further documents to the candidate to inform them of their positive application outcome and the next steps to ensure employment.
