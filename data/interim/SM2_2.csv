SM2_2,Coffe House Five Employee,"We believe this method of roasting creates some of the best coffee you will ever taste for a few reasons. First, it has a unique method of removing the chaff that the coffee beans shed as they heat. This is important because coffee beans are so absorbent if the chaff remained in the chamber during the roast, as it does in drum roasters, it would soak up some of that unwanted flavor. ",0
SM2_2,Coffe House Five Employee,"Another reason is its efficiency in heat transference. Our machine can reach higher temperatures in half of the time of many drum roasters, which is absolutely essential to ensuring a smooth cup of coffee with the least amount of acidity possible. Before the roasting process can truly extract the essential flavors of a given coffee bean, the natural moisture needs to be extracted and the longer it takes to do this the more time it allows for acids to build up and block the real flavor of the bean and potentially cause stomach irritation. So by reaching a higher temperature faster we minimize acid buildup and truly showcase the natural flavors of the bean. ",0
SM2_2,Coffe House Five Employee,"Just like corn here in Indiana, coffee is a seasonal crop so you may notice different coffees during different times of the year. This is because we are committed to providing the freshest and tastiest cup of coffee we can, and that means sometimes a certain type of bean just isn’t in season. ",0
SM2_2,Coffe House Five Employee,We provide brief descriptions of each bean and blend on the bags. Our goal is to present highly drinkable coffee through blends and single-origins (more information about these terms is in the About Coffee section of the handbook). ,0
SM2_2,Coffe House Five Employee,"Nitro coffee is the next wave in enjoying cold coffee. We use our freshly roasted Colombian single-origin coffee and brew it in cold water for 12 hours. It then goes into a standard keg and is attached to a nitrogen tap. The cold brewing method keeps acidity low and caffeine high. Serving it through the nitrogen tap, like a stout beer, creates a creamy, cascading coffee. ",0
SM2_2,Coffe House Five Employee,"The mixture of nitrogen gas and fresh roasted cold-brewed coffee delivers a creamy texture in the mouth, almost as if it already had cream. When served in-house we use a standard pilsner glass. We do sell it to go in a plastic cup, but encourage customers to drink it without a straw in order to get the full mouth feel of the creamy texture.",0
SM2_2,Coffe House Five Employee,Customers often ask about the caffeine content in fear that Nitro Coffee is extra caffeinated. In reality it isn’t although many people do drink it faster than they would cold coffee and experience the effects faster. ,0
SM2_2,Coffe House Five Employee,"You will need to know general information about each of our baked goods, including seasonals. All are baked daily right here in-house.Blueberry Muffins- More than a typical blueberry muffin, ours are incredibly moist and rich, give them a try! ",0

SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Energy Monitors: Some owners like to see the power displayed in Watts, rather than amperes, as indicated by the current meter, as this is more precise. A Watt is a Watt. These owners often add an energy monitor, such as the KIll-a-Watt®, or one of its clones. This type of meter provides a more accurate indication of the consumed power, as it does not matter what the voltage is. Also, it allows users to compare settings between roasters, even if one operates on 120-Volts and the other on 220- V olts. ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Digital Thermometers: Consumer-grade digital thermometers are available everywhere. The only important thing is that the type and the plug match with the thermocouple. If only a BT measurement is needed, many inexpensive single-channel meters are readily available. ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Some multimeters include a single K-type socket and a selector-switch position to convert the voltage into the equivalent temperature. If using multiple probes, multichannel thermometers are available, the most common having either two or four ports. A quick search of popular online sites, such as Amazon, will turn up dozens. ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Data Meters: However, digital thermometers and multimeters usually lack a computer interface. If a computer connection is wanted, lab-quality meters with a data port are available in one to four-channel versions. ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Arguably the most popular is the Mastech MS-6514. It is a 2-port meter that can run on its internal battery or a standard 5-volt USB power supply. A meter’s advantage over a thermometer is that a thermometer cannot interface to a computer; it only provides a temperature reading. On the other hand, a meter provides both a computer interface and a digital readout. So, one can use it with or without a computer. ",0

SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Roasting Software: With the Quest linked to a computer, one can easily display the temperatures provided by the thermocouples as curves against time, using a software application. ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,Such apps usually include the ability to develop and display a desired profile in the background. The user can then manipulate the heater and blower controls to duplicate the profile while roasting. ,0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Blower Control: A common modification to the Quest is to remove the resistor on models that have a continuously running blower. After the change, the blower motor will no longer run from 0 to about 3.8 ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Opening either the bean chute door or the chaff filter door has a similar effect, as it stops the blower from being able to draw air through the drum. In either case, one needs to be careful not to overheat the roaster.",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Air Intake: On some older models, air enters the roaster by suction through a small hole in the lower back of the drum enclosure. From there, it enters the drum via the gaps between the drum and the endplates. ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Thus, the air entering at the back will be cooler than the air entering at the front. To overcome this imbalance, some owners install a 6” piece of copper pipe in the hole. This modification directs the air to the middle of the drum, heating it more evenly. The only downside of this modification is that it reduces the aperture’s size, thus reducing airflow. ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Newer models do not have the aforementioned intake hole. Instead, several air intake tubes allow the air to enter the drum at critical points within the roasting chamber, ensuring incoming air flows over heaters before entering the roasting drum. ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Typically, two of these tubes enter the U-shaped space between each of the heaters. There are one or two more, usually high in the chamber. It should be possible to change older Quests to this form of intake by removing the backplate, blocking the original intake hole at the bottom, and drilling holes for added tubes. ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"The latest Quests have neither intake hole nor tubes. Instead, there are two slits of about 3 mm width, one on each side, low down on the roaster. These slits run the entire length of the outer case. ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"At least some of the roasters with a lower chaff drawer have this feature, the slits being on either side of the drawer assembly. ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"To convert older Quests to something similar, block the air intake hole, cut narrow slits in the lower case and open the slits to about 3 mm by bending. Make adjustments by changing the bend. ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Air Exhaust: The air from the blower exits the roaster at the back via slots in the case. The aperture size provided by these slots is significantly larger than the aperture of the air entrance hole, the tubes or the slits. ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Nevertheless, some owners cut away the metal between the slots to increase airflow. This modification also makes it easier to clean the blower fan. Note that there are two sets of slots, side by side ",0
SM2_2,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"The outboard set serves the blower, while the inboard set ventilates the electrical cabinet. The latest Quests have the metal between the slots opposite the blower exhaust twisted to direct the exhaust somewhat upward. ",0
