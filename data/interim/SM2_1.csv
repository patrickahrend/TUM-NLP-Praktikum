SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"The aim is to remotely interrupt the supply of electrical energy for an object, as a result of a customer change or due to open collection claims, via the central system.",1
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,The shutdown takes place by opening the breaker present in the terminal.,1
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"From the central system, a shutdown command is transmitted to the affected terminal.",1
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"The terminal executes the received command, i.e., the internal breaker interrupts the power supply of the customer system, returns the status of the shutdown to the central system and creates an entry in the logbook.",1
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,This status must be visible on the terminal.,1
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,With collection there is no possibility of an immediate on-site reconnection by the customer after the blocking.,1
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"Input is either deregistration of current customer, customer moves out without new tenant or customer does not pay after admonition process.",1
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"The supply of electrical energy is interrupted, the status ""interrupted"" is displayed at the terminal and in the central system. An entry in the logbook of the terminal has been created.",1
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,All values ​​collected by 00:00 o'clock must be received by the NL no later than 12 o'clock of the following calendar day.,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"It must also be possible to read out the load profile several times a day as period readout. For the legally required read-out of all values ​​collected up to 12 o'clock, only the missing values ​​have to be read out.",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,Readings for billing data and logbooks are not subject to the requirement of a daily readout and can therefore be individually planned by the NB as different order types.,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"The scope, e.g., logbooks, billing data, load profile data, and data content, e.g., partial reading of logbooks and load profiles, is definable.",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"For this it is also necessary to specify or configure a time selection plan differentiated after PUSH or PULL operation. In the case of PUSH operation, the time reading plan must be configurable in the meter, in PULL mode the readout plan is controlled by the central unit. In the readout plan, it must be specified which counters are to be read when and at what time the reading is considered to have ended.",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,The retrieval of missing values ​​must be supported by the AMCS accordingly. For division counter applies the,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"Prerequisite: There is bidirectional communication with the division counter, or the electricity meter stores the last measured value pushed by the division counter. The temporal resolution of the reading value thus depends on the push interval of the division counter.",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"Prerequisite: There is bidirectional communication with the division counter, or the electricity meter or gateway receives the last measured value pushed by the division counter.",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,The temporal accuracy of the reading thus depends on the push interval of the divisional counter.,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"The data should be protected along the entire transmission path according to the security concept ""OE requirements catalog end-to-end security smart metering"".",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"The electricity meter or gateway receives the encrypted data from the division meter and sends that data to the central system based on the security requirements of ""OE Requirement Catalog End-to-End Security Smart Metering"". If the technology and protocols support the end-to-end encryption requirement from the branch device to the central system, it should be possible to parameterize this function.",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"The goal is to receive current meter data at the request of authorized actors, see Role Definition in ""OE Requirements Catalog End-to-End Security Smart Metering"". This request is made by the NB by means of a specific read-out command to the desired counter. The scope and data content is definable.",0

SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,It must basically be possible to make an on-site reading of the meter using a mobile device via the service interface of the meter.,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"In order to meet the strict data protection regulations, the cryptographic parameters that authorize the readout of the affected meter must be stored in the mobile device.",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,It must therefore not be possible with these cryptographic parameters to read several or all terminals of the terminal equipment.,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,The NB will store the cryptographic parameters in the mobile device for the affected meter and send a service technician to the affected customer system to read out the affected meter.,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,The data thus obtained must be transmitted to the central system.,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,Each readout must be noted as access in the logbook.,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,The scope and data content is definable.,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"The following applies to division meters: On-site read-out is only possible if a communication interface based on the security requirements from ""OE Requirements Catalog End-to-End Security Smart Metering"" is provided on the division meter.",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"The exceeding of an active power limit, which was set and activated by the meter, is detected by the meter, entered in the logbook and transferred to the central system as ALARM or EVENT.",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"However, the excess does not lead to a shutdown of the customer system.",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,The terminal is released by a command from the central system for on-site (re) engagement.,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"The activation takes place as follows. First a release command is transmitted from the central system to the terminal. The terminal indicates this condition (e.g., READY, LED, ..).",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,This status is transferred to the central system as ALARM or EVENT and an entry is created in the logbook.,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"Second, from this time it can be turned on directly on the control of the terminal.",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"The terminal must indicate this status change (e.g., CONNECTED).",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,This status is transmitted to the central system as ALARM or EVENT and an entry is made in the logbook of the terminal.,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"If a customer e.g. Commissioned via a web portal direct intervention by the NB from a distance, the breaker of the terminal is turned on by remote command.",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,The activation takes place as follows. The switch-on command is transmitted from the central system to the terminal.,0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"The terminal switches on the power supply, displays this status on the display (e.g. CONNECTED) and an entry is created in the logbook.",0
SM2_1,Oesterreich Smart Metering,"This state is transmitted to the central system as ALARM or EVENT. In the event of a disturbed communication with the terminal, a time window for the validity of the command must be defined.",0
SM2_1,Coffe House Five Employee,We roast our own coffee in the coffeehouse on a weekly basis. There are two primary things to know about our coffee roasting: where we get our beans and how we roast them. ,0
SM2_1,Coffe House Five Employee,"Coffee does not grow in the United States. We import green coffee beans from the coffee growing regions of the world, which are generally between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, where conditions are ideal for coffee cherries to grow. We have teamed up with some great importers and farmers to get the absolute best coffee that benefits everyone involved, from the farmer to the importer to the coffee drinker here in Greenwood. ",0
SM2_1,Coffe House Five Employee,"The coffees we source are, at a minimum, Fair Trade certified. The goal of Fair Trade is to create partnerships and terms of trade that will be financially and ethically beneficial to producers. In simpler terms, this means the beans we roast are bought at a fair price that allows the hardworking people growing the coffee to make a living off their wages. ",0
SM2_1,Coffe House Five Employee,"Additionally, we will refer to some of the coffees we offer as “direct trade.” While there is no international certification for direct trade, as there is with Fair Trade, the general concept of direct trade is that our importers purchase beans directly from individual farmers. Fair Trade beans are typically purchased through coops, where several farmers deliver their beans which are then combined for sale, so there is no direct traceability of the bean back to a particular farm. ",0
SM2_1,Coffe House Five Employee,With direct trade we are able to tell you the specific farmer who produced the beans. These beans are typically of the highest quality and the farmer ends up receiving a higher percentage of the price you pay for your coffee here in Greenwood. ,0
SM2_1,Coffe House Five Employee,"Once the beans arrive at the coffeehouse in 50-65 pound bags and boxes, we then roast them on- demand in our roasting room. We use what is referred to as a fluid bed roaster, as opposed to a drum roaster used by most other coffee roasters. We believe there are some unique advantages to our fluid bed roasting process. The fluid bed roasting process, also known as hot air roasting, uses forced hot air to agitate and roast coffee beans. The perfectly controlled hot air flows over a tilted bed and circulates through the beans, roasting each bean evenly. This hot air reaches temperatures of between 450 and 485 degrees Fahrenheit. ",0

SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"The Quest’s most common modification is to enable digital temperature readings and to store/display them. Digitizing the Quest ranges from simple to complicated. For example:
● Replace the analogue thermometer with a thermocouple connected to a digital thermometer.
● Add additional thermocouples to measure more parameters.
● Connect thermocouples to a computer logging application.
This section of the Quest handbook provides only ideas and basic information.",0
SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Thermocouples are not all the same; there are numerous standards. Thermocouples generate a small voltage proportional to temperature, which thermometers convert to a temperature reading. A newer kind of thermocouple, the RTD, creates a resistance proportional to temperature, which thermometers convert to a temperature reading. ",0
SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"The most commonly used thermocouple for this application is the T- type. The type of thermocouple must match the type of meter/interface used.
At one time, it was possible to purchase a kit to make the following modifications. This kit is no longer on offer.",0
SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Usual BT Location: The thermometer threads on the roaster's faceplate are M8 x 1.25 mm. Probes with this screw size are available from several sources, including the factory and Coffee Shrub. These thermocouples screw into either the BT or the ET hole without modification. Non-threaded thermocouples need adapters, which most manufacturers sell.",0
SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Alternate BT Location: The stock BT thermometer location is optimum for most batch sizes, but it may be a bit too high for tiny batches. An alternate location is possible using one of the screw holes on the drum door's sight glass. To do this, remove the uphill* M4 sight-glass screw, and drill a tiny hole in the centre of it. Install a 1/16"" x 6"" thermocouple, such as the Omega TJ36-CASS-116G-2.00-SB- SMPW-M through the hole, bent so that the probe protrudes only one inch inside the faceplate. Although this probe will be subject to being impacted by the beans, its short length makes it strong enough to function without being damaged by the beans.",0
SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"ET measurement: Quest roasters come equipped with an M8 tapped hole at the proper location to measure the environmental temperature. This hole is closed off with a bolt. The same thermocouple used for measuring BT will work here, although some users prefer a thinner probe, as it is more responsive. When the roaster is empty, the BT and the ET measurements are nearly the same, being the drum’s air temperature. Once charged, the ET thermocouple continues to measure the drum’s air temperature, while the BT indicates an approximation of the bean temperature.",0
SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"MET Measurement: A modification to measure maximum environmental temperature (MET) is possible. MET is a measurement of the temperature between the drum and the case. The easiest solution is to remove one of the upper M4 hex screws securing the bean chute and insert a 1/8"" x 6"" thermocouple between the drum and the shell.",0
SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"For a better solution, drill a suitable hole in the centre of the M4 hex screw, and install a 1/16"" x 6"" thermocouple, such as the Omega TJ36-CASS-116G-6.00-SB-SMPW-M. The beans cannot impact a probe at this location. ",0
SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Therefore, one can install a long, thin probe; the lighter the probe, the more responsive the readings will be. This screw will be weaker than the other three holding the chute. Do not torque it down beyond a little more than finger tight.",0
SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"A 1/8"" probe can protrude straight out and be pushed in or pulled out to achieve optimum readings; a 1/16"" probe is too flexible. On an M3 roaster, to secure the thinner probe, bend the probe 90o 2.5” from the cable end. Route the wire across the bean chute’s face to the side of the roaster, and secure it with a cable tie. Be sure to bend the probe according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for a minimum radius. On an M6 roaster, push the probe completely in, which will position it correctly.",0
SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"The heaters on some roasters are mounted low in the roasting chamber; therefore, you can use either of the two upper screw holes. The heaters on other roasters are different. As viewed from the front, the left-hand one is mounted high; the other is mounted low. ",0
SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"Therefore, to avoid having the probe close to the upper element, we recommend mounting the probe in the right-hand hole. ",0
SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"The displayed value of the MET is highly dependent on the location of the probe. Even minor variations in placement make significant differences in the indicated temperature. Thus, it is of little use as an absolute value, especially for making comparisons between roasters ",0
SM2_1,Quest coffee Roaster Handbook,"However, most responsive of the three temperature readings (BT, ET, MET). Thus, it is an excellent choice to monitor the effects of heater and blower control changes.",0
