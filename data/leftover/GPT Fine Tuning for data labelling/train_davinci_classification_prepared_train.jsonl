{"prompt":"Process: The process for a travel insurance claim involves several important steps to ensure a fair and accurate resolution for both the insured traveler and the insurance provider. First, when a traveler contacts the insurance provider to report a claim, the provider will typically ask for detailed information about the event, including the necessary documentation to support the claim. Next, the insurance provider will review the policy coverage to determine if the claim falls under the policy's covered events.
