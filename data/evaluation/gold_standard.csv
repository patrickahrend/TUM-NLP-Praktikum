First, when a traveler contacts the insurance provider to report a claim, the provider will typically ask for detailed information about the event, including the necessary documentation to support the claim. Next, the insurance provider will review the policy coverage to determine if the claim falls under the policy's covered events.

Depending on the complexity of the claim and the amount of coverage requested, this process can take varying amounts of time. Once the claim has been assessed, the insurance provider will either issue payment for the covered expenses or deny the claim if it is not covered under the policy."

First, when a traveler contacts the insurance provider to report a claim, the provider will typically ask for detailed information about the event, including the necessary documentation to support the claim. Next, the insurance provider will review the policy coverage to determine if the claim falls under the policy's covered events. If the event is covered, the insurance company will then assess the claim and the supporting documentation to determine the amount of coverage, if any, that the traveler is entitled to receive. Depending on the complexity of the claim and the amount of coverage requested, this process can take varying amounts of time. Once the claim has been assessed, the insurance provider will either issue payment for the covered expenses or deny the claim if it is not covered under the policy."

SM2_2,"Thus, the air entering at the back will be cooler than the air entering at the front. To overcome this imbalance, some owners install a 6” piece of copper pipe in the hole. This modification directs the air to the middle of the drum, heating it more evenly. The only downside of this modification is that it reduces the aperture’s size, thus reducing airflow.

SM2_2,"Another reason is its efficiency in heat transference. Our machine can reach higher temperatures in half of the time of many drum roasters, which is absolutely essential to ensuring a smooth cup of coffee with the least amount of acidity possible. Before the roasting process can truly extract the essential flavors of a given coffee bean, the natural moisture needs to be extracted and the longer it takes to do this the more time it allows for acids to build up and block the real flavor of the bean and potentially cause stomach irritation. So by reaching a higher temperature faster we minimize acid buildup and truly showcase the natural flavors of the bean.

SM2_2,"We believe this method of roasting creates some of the best coffee you will ever taste for a few reasons. First, it has a unique method of removing the chaff that the coffee beans shed as they heat. This is important because coffee beans are so absorbent if the chaff remained in the chamber during the roast, as it does in drum roasters, it would soak up some of that unwanted flavor.
