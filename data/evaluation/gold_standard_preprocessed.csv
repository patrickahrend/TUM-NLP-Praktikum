SM2_2,we believe this method of roasting create some of the good coffee you will ever taste for a few reason first it have a unique method of remove the chaff that the coffee bean shed as they heat this be important because coffee bean be so absorbent if the chaff remain in the chamber during the roast as it do in drum roaster it would soak up some of that unwanted flavor,0,this process involve the smart meter be turn off once all credit from the customer have be consume the central system receive the message that the credit have be receive and trigger a turn - off in the terminal the power supply be interrupt and simultaneously a log entry be create and a return status be create the return status be display in the terminal and central system the central system then inform the customer about the current balance
