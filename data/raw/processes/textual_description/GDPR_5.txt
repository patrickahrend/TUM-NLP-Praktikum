The process is about the right to withdraw from the General Data Protection Regulations and
involves individuals being able to withdraw their data from a service upon request. Once a data subject sends a withdrawal request, it is checked to see if the data is relevant. If not, the withheld data is not being used anymore. If it is, the data subject is informed that all running business processes will be stopped if the withdrawal is continued. If the data subject chooses not to continue, the withdrawal is aborted; otherwise, all running business processes are stopped, and the withdrawal data is not being used anymore. Finally, the withdrawal is communicated.
