The right to access process is about the General Data Protection Regulation's right to access the stored data and starts with the Data subject requesting access. The first step involves the retrieval of the data subject's details from a data repository. In parallel, there is a review of elaborations, which likely refers to any analysis or processing previously conducted on the data subject's information. Once all relevant data and elaborations are collected, they are communicated to the data subject, fulfilling the request. The process ends when the request is fulfilled.
