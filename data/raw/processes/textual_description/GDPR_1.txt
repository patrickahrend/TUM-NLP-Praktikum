The process is from the General Data Protection Regulation and involves several steps whenever a data breach occurs regarding an individual's data. The process commences with a notification of a data breach to the data controller, triggering a series of critical actions to manage the incident. The data controller, upon receiving the notification, evaluates the breach's severity. If the breach is deemed notifiable, the national authority is promptly informed, and a detailed breach record is created. This record includes all relevant details necessary for thorough documentation and future reference. Concurrently, the data subject is also notified of the breach. This ensures transparency and allows the data subject to take any immediate personal measures to mitigate the impact. Communication with the data subject continues as the process unfolds, keeping them informed of the evolving situation.
The breach evaluation then proceeds to a decision point where it is determined if the breach was caused by high-risk factors. If the evaluation concludes that high-risk elements are present, the process moves towards a more rigorous evaluation, encompassing an in-depth security analysis.
Should the further evaluation confirm the high-risk nature of the breach, the data is then deleted or altered to mitigate the breach's impact, strictly adhering to the high security standards required in such scenarios. This decisive action is critical to preventing further unauthorized access or damage.
If the breach is not high-risk, or after the high-risk data has been dealt with, the national authority assesses whether to issue a public notification. If a public notification is necessary, the information is disseminated accordingly, ensuring that all potential impacted parties are aware of the breach.
Following the potential public notification, the process concludes with a final review to ensure all steps have been appropriately executed and documented. The end event signifies the closure of the incident response, with all actions completed, and the breach contained and managed according to protocol.
Throughout the process, data integrity and security, as well as compliance with regulatory standards, are maintained, demonstrating the organization's commitment to responsible data management and protection.
