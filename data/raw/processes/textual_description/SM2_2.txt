This process involves the smart meter being turned off once all credit from the customer has been consumed. The central system receives the message that the credit has been received and triggers a turn-off in the terminal. The power supply is interrupted, and simultaneously a log entry is created, and a return status is created. The return status is displayed in the terminal and central system. The central system then informs the customer about the current balance.
