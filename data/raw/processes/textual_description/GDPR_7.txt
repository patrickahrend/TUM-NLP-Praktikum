This process is about the right to be forgotten from the General Data Protection Regulations, which says a data subject has the right to terminate if its data should be deleted. It starts with the data subject requesting the data be forgotten. The service provider retrieves the data and checks if the received data is still relevant for the current service. If it is, an explanation is sent to the data subject. Otherwise, the data is eliminated, and the data subject is notified of the successful elimination.
