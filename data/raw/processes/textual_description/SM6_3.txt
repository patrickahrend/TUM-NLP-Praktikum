This process involves a Load Switch device, which serves as a possible replacement for a ripple control device or timer. On the load switch device, an independent replay switch program is configurable. The Central System sends the adapted switching programs to the load switch device. The load switch device then sets its switching table and simultaneously creates a log entry and sends an event. The event is then processed by the central system.
