This process involves a Smart Meter being turned off when a current customer logs off or a customer moves out without a new attendant moving in. The central system is notified, and the switch-off is done via the service interface. In the terminal, the power supply is interrupted, and simultaneously a log entry and response status are created. The response status is displayed within the terminal.
