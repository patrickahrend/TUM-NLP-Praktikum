This process involves turning off a smart meter based on the deregistration of a customer, the customer moving to another tenant, or the customer not paying after the administrative process. After receiving a message from the customer and moving it forward to the central system, then the switch is triggered and communicated to the terminal. The power supply is turned off, which leads to a log entry and the return of the status. The status is displayed in the terminal and central system.
