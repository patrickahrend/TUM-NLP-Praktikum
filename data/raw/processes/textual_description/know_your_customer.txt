Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations for individuals add identity checks to banks’ customer onboarding processes. The KYC process is not fully automated, so it adds to bank employees’ casework, making it one more thing to manage.
In the process of creating a new bank account, personal information and documents are gathered from the individual customer, and the name and further personal information are validated through various checks and confirmations. The customer's name is also checked against a Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) database to ensure they are not high-risk individuals, and any suspicious activity is flagged for further investigation. The new customer is manually reviewed following a set of guidelines for acceptability and risk level before being onboarded, and assistance is provided in navigating their account and accessing relevant products and services.
