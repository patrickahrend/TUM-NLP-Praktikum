This process involves the smart meter being turned off once an active power threshold is reached. The message is forwarded from the customer to the central system, which receives the alarm event. The Smart Meter is informed, and the power supply is interrupted. Simultaneously, a log entry and a feedback status are created. The status is displayed on the Smart meter and in the central system.
